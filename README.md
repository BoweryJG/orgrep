# RepSpheres

RepSpheres is a modern web application designed to elevate elite sales teams with precision intelligence. This project features:

- **Animated Orb Favicon:** The animated orb SVG is used as the site's favicon for a unique, branded browser experience.
- **Public Pages:** Includes accessible pages for Blogs, Podcasts, and Market iQ, with a private Intelligence Vault for authenticated users.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Modern Navigation:** Enhanced navbar with direct links to public resources and a private vault.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd orgrep
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to view the main site.
3. **Development:**
   - Edit HTML, CSS, and JS files directly.
   - The favicon is set via `<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="animated-orb.svg">` in `index.html`.

## File Structure

- `index.html` — Main landing page
- `blog.html`, `podcast.html`, `market.html` — Public pages
- `dashboard/vault.html` — Private Intelligence Vault
- `css/` — Stylesheets
- `js/` — JavaScript files
- `animated-orb.svg` — Animated orb favicon

## Notes
- For best favicon compatibility, consider exporting the animated orb as a `.gif` or `.png` for browsers that do not support SVG favicons.
- Admin controls are not present on public dashboards.
