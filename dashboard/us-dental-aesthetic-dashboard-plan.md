# US Dental & Aesthetic Industry Dashboard – Technical & UX Plan

## 1. Data Sourcing & Aggregation

**A. Provider Counts, Procedures, Prices, Trends**
- Use OpenRouter API (free models) to generate and summarize:
  - Provider counts by state/region
  - List of procedures (dental & aesthetic)
  - Typical price ranges for each procedure
  - Growth rates and trends (prompt model with public data summaries)
  - Psychological triggers by region (prompt model for behavioral insights)
- Supplement with public datasets or scraping where feasible (e.g., CDC, ADA, RealSelf, Yelp, Google Maps).
- Store all aggregated data in Supabase for fast retrieval and updates.

**B. Ad Spend & Client Acquisition**
- Use OpenRouter to estimate ad spend and time to land a client, based on industry benchmarks and public marketing data.
- Store these metrics in Supabase for dashboard use.

**C. SEM/SEO Data**
- Integrate free public data (Google Trends, Ubersuggest free tier) where possible.
- Use OpenRouter to generate keyword lists, SEO/SEM recommendations, and competitive insights.
- Store relevant SEM/SEO data in Supabase.

## 2. Dashboard Architecture

**Frontend:**
- HTML/CSS/JS stack (existing).
- Use Chart.js or Plotly.js for interactive charts and data visualizations.
- Animated SVGs and glowing effects for a visually stunning experience.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

**Backend/Data:**
- Supabase for:
  - Storing all dashboard data (providers, procedures, prices, trends, SEM/SEO, leads)
  - User authentication (if needed)
  - Lead gen form submissions
- Node.js/JS for:
  - Data aggregation scripts (fetching, scraping, OpenRouter API calls)
  - Scheduled updates to Supabase

**Data Flow:**
- On dashboard load, JS fetches data from Supabase.
- For new insights or updates, backend scripts call OpenRouter and update Supabase.
- Visualizations update dynamically as data changes.

## 3. Visual/UX Design

- Hero section: Animated US map with provider density heatmap and procedure hotspots.
- Interactive filters: State, city, procedure type, price range.
- Animated charts: Growth rates, price trends, ad spend, psychological triggers.
- "Mindblowing" visuals: Animated SVGs, glowing overlays, smooth transitions, parallax scrolling.
- Persistent CTA: "Get This Campaign" button.

## 4. Lead Generation Flow

- "Get This Campaign" button opens a modal form (name, email, business, interest).
- Form submission writes directly to Supabase (leads table).
- Optional: Trigger email notification or webhook to CRM.
- Option to download a personalized PDF report (generated client-side).

---

## 5. SEM/SEO Tool Integration

- Embed Google Trends widgets for relevant keywords.
- Use OpenRouter to generate and display keyword lists and SEO recommendations.
- Link to free tools (Google Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest free tier).

## 6. Example Data Flow & User Journey

1. User lands on dashboard.
2. Animated map and charts load with real-time data from Supabase.
3. User filters by region/procedure; charts and insights update.
4. User sees SEM/SEO opportunities for their area.
5. User clicks "Get This Campaign" → fills out form → info saved to Supabase.
6. User optionally downloads a personalized report.
